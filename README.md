# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
All of my practice with C# and MVC

# Misc Practice
*   Each folder contains an SLN file specific to the topic that was being practiced and commented in a way that it can later be used as a reference.
*   There are two assignment files that are a culmination of all of the specific practice folders with each section devided by assignment so it can be easily commented in and out to test each assignment. 

# NewsletterAppMVC
* A simple newsletter signup using MVC and SQL to manage a database of users subscribed to the newsletter.
* Allows the User to enter their information in to the database
* Allows the Admin to see all users signed up and remove them if requested
 
# MvcPracticalExercise
* Using MVC to create a web application to provide information for a car insurance quote
* Stores the users response in a database
* Includes an Admin page where the admin can see the information of quotes submitted and the calculated price based off of their response to the form. 

# ClassesAndObjects
* This project is utilizing Classes and Objects to recreate the game Twenty-One in a console application.
    * It will Ask the user their name, their funds, and how much they would like to bet.
    * The Dealer class will automatically deal a hand
    * The player will be able to hit or stay
    * And then the "bank" of either the dealer or player will be updated with the winnings
    * It currently only supports a single player but is designed in a way that additional players could be added.
    * Logs users information and hands dealt in a text file.
